Packaging Errors
----------------
* Before release we need to check that our files match with what's in
  Makefile.am.  We've changed savefile.py to qa-convert.pyin.  Created new
  files error.py and checkview.py.  Removed files SRPM.py, genericqa.py,
  srpmqa.py, and properties.py.  Need to make sure these are all taken care of
  as well as other problems that may not show up until later.
* Need to clear my gconf cache of any keys created during testing that aren't
  going to be distributed to guard against error.
  
Programming Errors
------------------
* Use gtk.TreeStore.set instead of self.set in checklist wherever possible.
  Significant performance boost.
* Need to hook the properties into the checklist.  Right now things are just
  one step beyond a placeholder.
* The new CheckView Code is not interacting with qareviewer quite right.
  When loading a saved file it is not displaying itself.  This is because the
  CheckView is not setup to load an SRPM.  We need to decide how the new model
  is going to load and store SRPM information.
  
  + On start, we load checkView and Review and start a Druid for the user to
    select load savefile (Can also be commandline) or start from checklist.

      If savefile:
      
        Load a saved checklist and all its properties.  Do we also need to run
        initiation on the checklist/SRPM?
	
      If checklist:

        Then we load the checklist but display a screen telling the user what
	to use to start a review. (This can be a msg or None)

          For SRPM Reviews this is a msg to specify the SRPM to load.

* For tests somethings have to be preconfigured for certain tests to be
  performed.  In fedora.us some tests may need the network.  Others may need
  the SRPM to be available (or the network).  Others may need to have the
  unarchived rpm available.

  - In the softwarerelease checklist we need to have the network to check the
    svn repository.  The repository or a tarball needs to be accessbile to run
    make dist-check, et al.

* There's something wrong with directories and saving/loading the reviews.
  After saving the review, I'm unable to reload just by putting in the name
  without any path information.

Working: Need to test
---------------------
* Creation of Custom checklist items is not being displayed in the CheckView
  even though it is being created in the checklist.
* Change of state in the Checklist is not being reflected in the Review.
* Need to set the category state from checklist.py
* No longer need the checklist to connect to the row-inserted and row-changed
  signals as we do not track modifications to rows anymore and all adds go
  through add_entry so we can perform the add to self.entries there instead.
* Need to migrate code to set the category state into checklist.py.
* When checking for duplicates we probably want to treat things in a case
  insensitive manner.  having "Upstream GPG Checked" and "upstream gpg checked"
  probably doesn't make sense.
* We don't need to create a checklist on program start anymore.  Wait until
  we have data (A savefile load or SRPM load) to instantiate.
