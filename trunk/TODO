glade/GUI:
==========
* Create a logo to go along with the icon.  Think up some other small pixmaps
  for the menu/toolbar: toggle Preview, new from bugzilla, new from SRPM,
  Publish Report, Submit Report
* When the reviewer really should add additional information in a note, how
  should we make it happen?  A field in the XML file under state?  And that
  causes qa-assistant to pop up a textEntry dialog when the item enters that
  state?
* Add i18n support.
    
Functions:
==========
Everything in this list requires rethinking because of the new Functions and
Properties structure.

* These require integration with the Functions features

  - Publish Button should be added to toolbar [Need icon]

    + Pressing Submit will build the review and submit to bugzilla.
    [Needs to have a function written and registered in fedoraus.py]

  - Add a New dialog to take input about bugzilla

    + If new then make sure we have both a bugzilla # and an SRPM
    [Needs to be implemented via properties]

  - Disable pieces of the QA Action menu when there is no SRPM being reviewed
    [Done]
    
  - Accelerators for QA Action items
    [Done]

* Security:  We need to fill in two pieces here: 1) The checklist needs to be
  gpg signed.  2) We have to check that byte-compiled function files are valid
  If we can set the interpreter to always byte compile the functions then that
  should work.

Extra GNOME Functionality:
==========================
* Update to pygtk-2.4.
  
  - Embed the 2.4 file selector widget in the druid. [Loading may be
    separated from the druid].
  - Switch to the 2.6 ComboBox Renderer instead of optionrenderer.
  - Convert from self.__gobject_init__()/gobject.GObject.__init__() to
    gtk.CLASSNAME.__init__(self) since the changes to make this work are in 2.6
    (May have gone into 2.4)
    + optionrenderer
    + treetips
    + checklist

Programming:
============
* Revamp Druid.  On start, QA-Assistant will display a blank page.  If the
  user selects New they will be taken into the Druid.  The Druid will only
  follow the path for new Reviews.  Load functionality will just use the file
  chooser.  Properties checking (for entry of required values) is done by the
  Properties themselves.  Druid on new, PropDialog, and Review:Publish will
  utilize these checks.  Load will not as Outputting the Review will take care
  of this.
* GenericQA needs to provide a menu item to toggle treetip display
* Command line argument parsing

  - If a savefile is given, open that
  - Use optparse/optik

* Enhance tracking entries into the editor.  We want
  people to be able to shift text around from Needswork and Non-blocker, and
  to add to them but we want to keep track of what entry is associated with
  what entry id.
* Automate some review tasks

  - checkheader
  - checksig
  - verify source against spec file/canonical URL
  - look at the new fedora-startqa for more ideas.  Perhaps we can coordinate
    and use fedora-startqa in the backend.  (Look through their SRPM stuff --
    it might be better code than I have... If we can put it into a SRPM class
    like I have, then it could be callable from either my script or theirs.)
    
* Update to the fedora QAFormat output style
* XML stuff to conform better with libxml2's guidelines document:
  file:///usr/share/doc/libxml2-devel-2.6.6/guidelines.html
  (Namespace, URL, Make sure I follow recommendations for element/attribute)
* Create a common XML save format/checklist with Erik LaBianca for the
  checklist.  This will involve integrating XML with test infrastructure.

DTD
===
* Define a new DTD location on berlios instead of sourceforge.
* Write a proper check that we can use a file (os.access doesn't work for
  this purpose.  [How does review.py work?])
  
  - For both review.py and savefile we could use try: except IOERROR: to trap
    failure to write the file.

* Separate error dialogs from the widgets.  Error dialogs should be created
  by QAReviewer.  Subordinate widgets (like review) should raise an Exception
  when the encounter an error and qareviewer should then display the error
  dialog, allow the user to fix it, and rerun the subordinate widget's
  function.

  - May not apply to the Druid.

Build:
======

* Fix the uninstalled_file lookups

  - DTDs have to be selected correctly when the program isn't installed.
    This can be done by setting a libxml environment variable
    XML_CATALOG_FILES.  May also be possible to use xmlCatalogAddLocal() to
    do this.
    Also look into: xmlCatalogResolve(),xmlCatalogLocalResolve() Family of
    functions.
    Setting XML_DEBUG_CATALOG will allow us to debug what's going on.
    http://www.xmlsoft.org/catalog.html
  - Program should use uninstalled files only when it is uninstalled.  If it is
    installed but happens to be run in a build directory, it needs to
    recognize that.  Also, there is currently a small period where the
    program searches for uninstalled files when it is installed.  This needs
    to be changed so installation removes this penalty.
  - DTDs and the Druid would both have to be special-cased now to make things
    work uninstalled.  The DTDs could work if the user is connected to a
    network or if I can get libxml2 to recognize a private xmlcatalog.  The
    Druid and the rest of the current consumers of uninstalled_files might be
    better served by creating an uninstalled version of paths.py that lists
    the directories inside the source instead of directories in the system.
    Currently paths.py is built from paths.pyin at build time.  We'd need to
    create one paths.py at build time and a separate one at install time to
    make this work.

    + This looks like the way to go.  The new objective is to set all
      information in the paths.py and have minimal setup processing and no
      special processing in the main body of the program.

* Finish writing unittests for the program.  We've barely scratched the
  surface of this.  When completed it should allow one to quickly figure
  out what's working and what's broken in the package.

  - Basically need a set of unittests for each object defined in the program.
    Don't yet know how to unittest the widgets.  The model objects and the
    program object should work much better, though.

QA Convert
==========

* Add commandline parsing to override the checklist type we're to convert to.

Documentation
=============

I need to write documentation and take screenshots of using QA Assistant.  The
programmatic interface for opening the documentation is pretty simple.  I've
got it in and commented right now.  In order to create it, though, I need to
write the docbook xml.  I've come to the conclusion that writing docbook
currently lacks quite a bit.  I want to be able to write my content and then
have something to output it.
