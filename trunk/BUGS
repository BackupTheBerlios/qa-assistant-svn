Reporting New Bugs
------------------
Please report new bugs into the bug tracker at berlios.

Packaging Errors
----------------
* Before release we need to check that our files match with what's in
  Makefile.am.  We've changed savefile.py to qa-convert.pyin.  Created new
  files error.py and checkview.py.  Removed files SRPM.py, genericqa.py,
  srpmqa.py, and properties.py.  Need to make sure these are all taken care of
  as well as other problems that may not show up until later.  Easy method to
  do this is to do a make distcheck.  Then compare the packages in the tarball
  against our working copy.
* Need to clear my gconf cache of any keys created during testing that aren't
  going to be distributed to guard against error.
* configure.ac should be modified to check for pygtk, gnome-python, etc as
  python modules; not for the pygtk-devel C level interface.  We don't need
  to build anything against pygtk-devel; we just need the pygtk module to
  test and run.

Programming Errors
------------------
* src/checkload.py:  Need to take some code that's almost verbatim duplicated
  in qareviewer.py and make it exist in only one place.  checkload is
  currently where all the loading takes place so it makes the most sense.
  But in the future we will have new reviews in checkload and loaded files
  elsewhere so perhaps qareviewer is the best place for this.
* Use gtk.TreeStore.set instead of self.set in checklist wherever possible.
  Significant performance boost. [Done -- audit]
* Define default preferences within the code in case the schema hasn't been
  registered with gconf.
* For tests somethings have to be preconfigured for certain tests to be
  performed.  In fedora.us some tests may need the network.  Others may need
  the SRPM to be available (or the network).  Others may need to have the
  unarchived rpm available.

  - In the softwarerelease checklist we need to have the network to check the
    svn repository.  The repository or a tarball needs to be accessbile to run
    make dist-check, et al.
* Redirect gpg output to /dev/null.

Working: Need to test
---------------------
* Need to set the category state from checklist.py
* No longer need the checklist to connect to the row-inserted and row-changed
  signals as we do not track modifications to rows anymore and all adds go
  through add_entry so we can perform the add to self.entries there instead.
* Need to migrate code to set the category state into checklist.py.
* We don't need to create a checklist on program start anymore.  Wait until
  we have data (A savefile load or SRPM load) to instantiate.
