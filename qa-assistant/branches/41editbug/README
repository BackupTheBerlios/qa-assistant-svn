QA Assistant -- Gnome Quality Assurance checklist

QA Assistant is a Gnome-Python application that assists a reviewer in
performing Quality Assurance.  It creates a checklist that the reviewer fills
in.  When the checklist is filled, the application prints out a review for the
reviewer to submit.  The current code includes a checklist that works with
the Quality Assurance process of Fedora.us, the contributed packages section
of the Fedora Linux Distribution.  As the code matures, more attention will
be focused on creating modules for other QA situations.

Quality Assurance consists of inspecting a variety of similar products to be
certain that they conform to certain standards for proper working.  Currently,
although there is a large body of automated quality assurance methods
(automated testing), there is a lack of open source tools to help with human
driven QA.  QA Assistant fills this gap by displaying a checklist in a
friendly, GUIfied manner for the human reviewer to fill out.

QA Assistant is currently into its first release.  It has a GUI, working
checklist for the Fedora Project, and can ouput a review.  Still to be worked
on are an interface to bugzilla (reading information from a ticket and
submitting output to a ticket), associating the checklist with a set of
actions the program can perform automatically, using GConf2 for preferences,
a new display widget that can display and allow editing of the XML format of
the Review, and general speedups.

Requirements:
* python 2.2 (2.3 not tested but in planning.)
* python bindings for libxml2
* pygnome2 and pygtk2
* python-rpm
* Unix system to run on

Features:
* Graphical GNOME Checklist
* Uses an XML definition of it's checklist for extensibility
* Current checklist targets Fedora.us/Fedora Extras Quality Assurance Process
  for verifying SRPM Packages
* Automated tasks associated with SRPM QA

Source code for version 0.1 available from:
http://www.tiki-lounge.com/~toshio/software/qa-assistant/qa-assistant-0.1.tar.gz
Do not attempt to install this version.  Run it directly from the untarred
directory.
./qa-assistant <SRPM>
where <SRPM> is a Redhat Package Manager Source RPM (Such as found at:
http://www.tiki-lounge.com/~toshio/fedora/pyrexdocc-0.1-0.fdr.1.src.rpm)

Only currently implemented checklist is compatible with the documentation and
goals for the contributed packages section of the Fedora Linux Project.  In
particular, the contributed packages section which is currently hosted at

http://www.fedora.us

It is hoped that there will soon be a sourceforge project for QA Assistant.
