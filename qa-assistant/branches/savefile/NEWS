Checklist Reviewer to aid Quality Assurance
-------------------------------------------

0.4
===
This release marks completeness of core features.  Everything needed to write
a review from within QA Assistant is now available.  I'm now using qa-assistant
to write QA reports for the fedora-us system.  The save and checklist formats
used in this release are not permanent.  Talks with Erik LaBianca are leading
to a new combined format that will allow embedding tests for items within
the checklist, thus being much more flexible in what can be provided.

* You can now add your own checklist items to a review.  Use the
  "QA Actions::Add checklist item" menu item when you want to add a comment
  that the standard checklist does not support.
* Saving and loading in-progress reviews is now supported.
* Some minor bugfixes to the python build process.
* Fix output entry when the output contains angle brackets "<>"

This release is largely an infrastructure and cosmetic enhancement.  The
program now has a build and install process and there was some work to
make the current resolution to a checklist item more apparent at a glance.
The major "new" feature was to correct a bug that prevented the reviewer
from editing the output.

* Displays the SRPM that's being reviewed in the titlebar and statusbar
* Colorized output for checklist items.
* Now has an automake/autoconf build.  This means the package is now
  installable with standard ./configure ; make; make install steps
* RPM spec file included and rpm's shipped with package.
* When publishing a review, QA Assistant now checks to see if it's in an
  Incomplete state.
* Fixed a bug that prevented editing of the output string in the checklist
* Checklist actions now appear in the QA Actions menu instead of the File
  menu.  (The sole exception is the New actions.  These will probably be
  replaced with a Druid that walks one through selecting a checklist and
  file to QA.  The current method of selecting an SRPM to QA will remain
  on the QA Action menu for those who select a checklist manually.
* Website and downloads moved to sourceforge.

This version concentrates on tidying up usability problems in the first
release.  Tooltip-like help for checklist items and loading SRPMS from the
menu are the major enhancements.

* Ability to start an SRPM QA from the menu and the toolbar
* Description of a checklist item displayed in a tooltip
* Optionrenderer now looks more like a combo box
* Speedups to Optionrenderer code
* Directory remembering for the File Selection dialogs
* Published reviews now use '*' bullets instead of '-' to be more GPG friendly
* Move hashes to top of review in anticipation of fedora-startqa format
* Better handling of errors on loading SRPMs
