glade/GUI:
==========
* Publish Button should be added to toolbar
* Submit Button should be added to toolbar
  - Pressing Submit will build the review and submit upstream and down.
* Add a New dialog to take input about bugzilla
  - If new then make sure we have both a bugzilla # and an SRPM
* Pressing save should dump the present state to an xml file
  - class SaveFile (Not going to be part of the Review widget)
* Pressing open should load a dumped xml file
* Create a logo to go along with the icon.  Think up some other small pixmaps
  for the menu/toolbar: toggle Preview, new from bugzilla, new from SRPM,
  Publish Report, Submit Report
* When the reviewer really should add additional information, how should we
  make it happen?  A field in the XML file under state?  And that causes
  qa-assistant to pop up a textEntry dialog when the item enters that state?
* Currently the QA functions are encapsulated into a gtk.Menu.  I think this
  is wrong in the long run.  Instead of the main program creating a QA
  object and operating on it, it should create a QA object and have the
  object operate on it.
  (QAReviewer is really a parent class of the QA objects.  But I don't see a
  way to model this efficiently as we need to create the GUI and base items
  every time the program starts.  Then, when the user chooses a specific
  checklist we would have to destroy the old object and instantiate a new one
  for the new QA object.)
  - QAReviewer needs to implement a set of hooks that the QA object attaches
    to.  For instance, QAReviewer provides the QAActions menu at
    self.QAMenuItem.  QA object should create the menu and set:
    self.app.QAMenuItem.set_submenu(menu)
  - Things that may be overridden in this manner:
    - QAMenu
    - Allowable Properties
    - Review object output format
* Accelerators for QA Action items
* Disable pieces of the QA Action menu when there is no SRPM being reviewed

Extra GNOME Functionality:
==========================
* Create preferences infrastructure : check PREFERENCES for ideas.
* Druid on New

Programming:
============
* Command line argument parsing
  - If a savefile is given, open that
* Enhance tracking entries into the editor.  We want
  people to be able to shift text around from Needswork and Non-blocker, and
  to add to them but we want to keep track of what entry is associated with
  what entry id.
* Automate some review tasks
  - checkheader
  - checksig
  - verify source against spec file/canonical URL
  - look at the new fedora-startqa for more ideas.  Perhaps we can coordinate
    and use fedora-startqa in the backend.  (Look through their SRPM stuff --
    it might be better code than I have... If we can put it into a SRPM class
    like I have, then it could be callable from either my script or theirs.)
* review.publish needs to do wordwrapping of lines.  Look into whether a
  textBuffer object has the necessary wordwrapping even without a textView.
  (python 2.3's textwrap would do this for publish, not sure about viewing.)
* Update to the fedora QAFormat output style
* XML stuff to conform better with libxml2's guidelines document:
  file:///usr/share/doc/libxml2-devel-2.6.6/guidelines.html
  (Namespace, URL, Make sure I follow recommendations for element/attribute,
  catalogs!, and catalog setup)
* Create a common XML save format/checklist with Erik LaBianca for the
  checklist.  This will involve integrating XML with test infrastructure.
