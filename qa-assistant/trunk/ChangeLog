2004-04-29 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r71    
    * genericqa.py: Add Rev and Id keyword expansion.
    * treetips.py: Add Rev and Id keyword expansion.
    * review.py: Bugfix ListStore.append takes a tuple, not a straight sequence
      of values.
    * srpmqa.py: Add Rev and Id keyword expansion.
    * checklist.py: Beginning of changes to allow Saving of work.
      - Add a MODIFIED entry to the tree.
      - self.addPaths hash to alert us that an entry is being added.
      - __modified_row and __added_row replace broken __add_entry_to_lookup
      - __modified_row: new function
        + Sets the MODIFIED flag on the row.
        + Adds new entries to the entries hash for quick lookup of existing
          checklist items.
      - __added_row: New function
        + Sets MODIFIED flag on a new row so it gets saved.
        + Adds the row path to addPaths so __modified_row can add it when the
          SUMMARY information becomes available.
    * data/checklist.dtd: Use ENTITY for Enumerated values.
    * data/qasave.dtd: New dtd that defines a savefile.
    * data/sample-save.xml: A sample savefile.
    * Makefile.am: Move comments on the install-data-hook above the definition
      to make it more portable.
    
2004-04-29 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r70    
    * genericqa.py:
      - Add an attribute to cache the path where we add custom checklist items.
      - Use the customItemsPath attribute instead of searching.
      - Don't emit the row-inserted signal manually, gtk takes care of it
        automatically.
    * review.py:
      - Add an attribute to cache items being added.
      - Stop using self.tree.  It was unnecessary to hold a reference to the
        tree because it was sent to our functions whenever we needed to use
        data from it.
      - __update_data(): Now does most of the work when adding entries as well.
      - __add_data(): Functionality moved to __update_data because row-inserted
        is emitted when the row is created.  But it is created empty.  So we
        have no way to use it at that point.  New __add_data() just flags the
        treeStore's path as being added so __update_data doesn't have to
        guess that an addition is coming.
    
2004-04-27 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r69    
    * paths.py.pyin: Add Id and Rev keyword expansion.
    * review.py: Change 'if variable == True:' to 'if variable:' form
    * gnomeglade.py: Fix typo: gnome.PARAM_GNOME_SYSCONFIGDIR => SYSCONFDIR
    * qareviewer.py: Change 'if variable == True:' to 'if variable:' form
    * configure.ac:
      - Add a header to describe what the file does.
      - Set Id and Rev keyword expansion
      - Check for PYGNOME existance as well as pygtk.
    * TODO: Reformat.
    * qa-assistant.spec.in: Add Requires gnome-python-gconf2 and pygtk2
    * Makefile.am: Add a header and Id Rev expansion
    * glade/qa-assistant.strings, glade/qa-assistant.glade:
      - Change QA Actions Mnemonic
      - Change the Start label to reflect the change in menus
      - Add others to the AUTHORS section of the about dialog
    * NEWS: Started summary of what the changes are for this release
    
2004-04-27 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r68    
    * genericqa.py:
      - Change the 'Add Checklist Item' mnemonic

        review items using this action.
    * treetips.py: Do not pop-up a tooltip if there is no tooltip text.
    * review.py: Load new checklist entries into the Review widget when they

      add to the SRPM Actions.
    * checklist.py:
      - Change function names from __xmlToEntry() form to __xml_to_entry()
      - Create a new data struct 'entries' which is a map of Summary => iter.
        The immediate need was to have fast lookups of what Summary items
        appear in the checklist.  Eventualy, the Review widget should also use
        this to quickly access an iter from a Summary value.
      - colorize_output: Move colorization of output to its own function.
      - __add_to_entry_lookup: New function to support the entries dict.
    * qareviewer.py:

    * configure.ac: Bump version to 0.4
    * TODO: Druid on New note
    * qa-assistant.spec.in: Make the desktop install conform to Fedora Extras

      Created an install-data-hook that sets compiled in paths properly
    * NEWS: Begin the 0.4 notes
    
2004-04-21 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r65

    * treetips.py: FIXME notes
    * ChangeLog: Update to rev 61
    * qareviewer.py:
      - New start label message reflects QA Action menu.  Need some
        architectural thought here.
      - Not Yet Implemented Dialog path bugfix.
    
    
2004-04-20 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r63    
    * configure.ac: Generate qa-assistant.spec
    * TODO: Spec file written
    * qa-assistant.spec.in: First cut spec file for qa-assistant.  Needs some
      touchups to the desktop file handling and check to make sure the URL and
      Source0 download link are correct.
    * Makefile.am:
      - Add genericqa.py and srpmqa.py to the dist scripts.
      - Remove qa-assistant from the nodist section.  It is already in the
        bin_SCRIPTS target.  Add qa-assistant manually to CLEANFILES.
      - Add the *.spec and *.spec.in to EXTRA_DIST
    * NEWS: Spec file and QA Actions menu notes.
    
2004-04-20 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r62

      - Add a default_width of 400 to the Not Yet Implemented Dialog.
    
2004-04-19 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r61    
    * genericqa.py: A new subclass of gtk.Menu.  This represents a generic QA
      Menu with callbacks for its menu items.  Actions that can be performed
      on all QA checklists should be added here.
    * srpmqa.py: A new subclass of genericqa.py that adds menuitems and callbacks
      for actions specific to writing a review of an srpm.
    * checklist.py: Comments for each of the TreeModel field enums
    * qareviewer.py: Import the proper QA Menu code depending on the type of
      checklist we load.
    * glade/qa-assistant.glade, glade/qa-assistant.strings: Create the empty
      QA Action menu that qareviewer.py fills with a GenericQA or SRPMQA object.
    
2004-04-16 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r60    
    * review.py: Remove the formatting tags before spitting out the review
    * checklist.py: Change Needs-Reviewing output back to None as it turns out
      it wasn't necessary and broke the Review widget's publish method.
    * qareviewer.py: 
      - Popup a message dialog if the reviewer wants to publish and the review
        has a resolution of Incomplete.
      - Publish review dialog is now destroyed whether it's successful or not.
      - gtk.get_current_event_time, event.time, and menu.popup have an overflow
        bug.  event.time and menu.popup use 32Bit Python signed ints.
        get_current_event_time returns a Python Long type.  The C gtk library
        uses an Unsigned 32 bit int.  Problem should probably be fixed in the
        bindings by using Python Long for python code and coerce to C unsigned
        int when sending to the library.  My temporary work around is to munge
        the long type into an int32 that's wrapped into the negatives.
    * TODO, NEWS: Check for 'Needs-Reviewing' Resolution done.
    
2004-04-16 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r59    
    * checklist.py, qareviewer.py: Give the whole props array to the new checklist
      rather just the colors.
    * TODO: Note that textwrap is a python 2.3 method.
    
2004-04-15 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r58    
    * properties.py: Add *Color properties
    * review.py: Set the output renderers to use markup instead of text
    * checklist.py: Add color information to the output strings.  The color
      information is stored in the Properties object which is not a part of
      the checklist.  So the information is given when initializing the
      checklist.  Not ideal.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Set output renderer to use markup instead of text
      - Note about __load_checklist bug
      - Set colors when editing an output string
    * TODO: Remove colorize.  Add spec file
    * NEWS: Add coloiize to the list of new features
    
2004-04-15 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r56    
    * qareviewer.py: Fix a bug where reloading the checklist causes editing of the

    * Ignore files generated by autoconf/automake

2004-04-14 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r48    
    * properties.py: Uncomment bugzilla stuff although it doesn't do anything.
    * paths.py.pyin: Python file that has variables which make expands to point
      at various parts of the installation path.  This gives us access to the
      paths the user gives to configure for Gnome functions.
    * qa-assistant.desktop.in: First stab at a desktop file to put things in the
      menus.  It is a .in because intltool messes with it.  However, we aren't
      yet using that.
    * qa-assistant, qa-assistant.pyin: Moved qa-assistant to .pyin because we
      need make to append the install directory ($pkgdatadir) to the python
      import path.
    * gnomeglade.py:
      - Set the gnome PARAM_APP_* properties on the GnomeApp object using the
        confiugre values stored in paths.py
      - GnomeApp.__uninstalled_file(): looks for the filename in the program's
        directory.  Useful when testing the program in the build directory.
      - GnomeApp.locate_file(): simulate the libgnome function.  Look for
        files in a specified FileDomain and return a list of possibilities.
      - Use __uninstalled_file and locate_file to load the user interface.
    * README:
      - Changes for sourceforge and the fact that it can now install
      - Bump version to 0.3
    * checklist.py: Accomodate the checklist now having a type.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Separate programName from programHumanName
      - Bump version to 0.3
      - Set gnome properties on the GnomeApp
      - Use locate_file to find the program data/pixmap/glade files.
    * configure.ac: Configure script for qa-assistant
    * data/checklist.dtd: Bump version to 0.2 and make a type attribute for
      checklist so we can load certain menus based on the checklist type.
    * data/fedoraus.xml: Version bump and specify type=SRPM
    * Makefile.am: Makefile.am for qa-assistant
    * autogen.sh: Minimal autogen.sh
    * glade/qa-assistant.glade: Remove icon and logo lines.  These are now set
      programmatically.  (Otherwise the path names would have to be munged
      in the glade file.)
    * NEWS: Begin charting major 0.3 changes
    
2004-04-11 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r44    
    * ChangeLog: updated to r43

    * NEWS: Note that the toolbar now has working "New" button
    
2004-04-10 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r42    
    * properties.py: Fixup SRPM Exception passing
    * qareviewer.py: Document what we want to do eventually with Security
      Exceptions from reading in SRPMs.  The infrastructure should all be there
      now.  Just needs detail work.
    * SRPM.py:
      - Fix up Exception handling.  May need more work but I need more code
        that utilizes the exceptions to see what to do.
      - Detect errors when trying to read a file that isn't an rpm
      - Fix __hash_directories crash
    * data/qa-assistant.glade: Set the startLabel to sensitive so things
      display in a normal state instead of greyed out.
    * AUTHORS: New file crediting Stephen Kennedy for gnomeglade.py and
      Ville Skyttä for rpm2cpio implementation
    * ChangeLog: Sync to r41
    * TODO: Check off two items

      - __load_checklist()  loads the checklist from the data file
      - __SRPM_into_properties() loads a new SRPM file into the properties
        structure
      - __check_readiness() figures out whether we've got an SRPM and are ready

    * treetips.py: Fix timeoutID to keep from popping up tooltips when we aren't
      hovering over a tooltip item.

      program (except as ideas.)
    * TODO: Add note to work on scripts to install and distribute the program

    * data/fedoraus.xml: Set SRPM GPG signed entry to display by default
    
2004-04-01 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r30    
    * TODO: Add note about fedora-startqa script
    * data/fedoraus.xml: Finish inputting the fedoraus checklist
    
2004-04-01 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r29    
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Only load an SRPM if one is given on the commandline.  Print a usage
        message otherwise.
      - Catch exceptions from loading the SRPM -- but don't do anything
        useful with them yet.
      - Fix the Auto-display of non-Pass items to display non-blockers as well.
    * TODO: update SRPM.py entry
    * SRPM.py:
      - Added some simple exceptions.  May need more refinement as we progress.
      - Check if the SRPM file exists and is readable instead of just if the
        file has the potential to be readable.
      - Some cleanups to how we use python file objects.
      - Reordered the functions to be somewhat more logical.  Still some work
        to be done there.
      - Check for previous unarchival of rpm.  Still needs a few problem cases
        resolved nicely.
      - Fix up the internal rpm2cpio code.  It now works with gzip compressed
        payloads.  BZ2 stuff needs python-2.3 and someone to take a look at the
        different interface.  
    
2004-03-30 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r28    
    * checklist.py: Change the Display tag to an attribute of entry
    * data/checklist.dtd: Ditto

    * review.py: Fix logic in deciding the overall review resolution
    * checklist.py:
      - Removed INPUT from the checklist file.  Needs some rethinking before we
        add something like it back in.
      - Validate the checklist file with the checklist.dtd
      - Fixed the Exception names.
      - Removed 'output' tag from checklist.  Output is now the content of the
        state tag rather than having its own tag.
    * qareviewer.py: Catch exceptions from libxml2.treeError as well as
      libxml2.parserError
    * TODO: Logo item and needing something to "force" the user to edit output
      items when they could add useful information that the program can't guess.
    * data/checklist.dtd:

      - Changes to output and input for new dtd.

    * qareviewer.py:
      - Reorder menu callbacks in depth first order they appear in the menu bar.
      - publish_activate: Prompt user for a filename to save the review to.
    * TODO: Remove items that have been completed and notes to enhance others.
    * glade/qa-assistant.strings, glade/qa-assistant.glade: Remove the
      FileSelection dialog from the glade definition.  It's very easy to add
      fileSelectionDialogs programmatically so that's how I'm going to do it.
    
2004-03-29 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r25    
    * review.py: publish(filename) method implemented.  Call the publish method
      on a review object to print out the review.  Note:  further work could be
      done for word wrapping and WYSIWYG-ness.
    * qareviewer.py: connect publish menu item to review.publish()
    
2004-03-29 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r24    
    * review.py: Finish the display methods.  Implemented as a listStore that
      connects to the QAReviewer.checklist.tree row-changed signal and mirrors
      the data there.
    * checklist.py: Change resolution state from 'Needs Reviewing' to
      'Needs-Reviewing' because of limitations of DTD (Wish libxml2 did
      XML Schemas...)
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Allow editing the OUTPUT Field
      - Change resolution state names because of DTD
      - Change the reviewPane toggle to use hide/show rather than 
        remove/insert
    * TODO: Minor reorganizations
    * checklist.dtd: Initial DTD for our checklist data files.  Preparatory
      for adding validation to the checklist.py script.
    * fedoraus.xml: Changes to naming due to DTD limitations
    * glade/qa-assistant.glade: Add a ViewPort into the ScrolledWindow.
      Renamed ViewPort to reviewPane and ScrolledWindow as reviewScroll

    * glade/fedora-qareviewer.glade, glade/fedora-qareviewer.strings:
      Renamed to qa-assistant.glade and qa-assistant.strings

      TODO, qareviewer.py: Change reference to editorPane to reviewPane
    * fedora-qareviewer: Rename to qa-assistant.
      - Remove constants from here that are going into qareviewer.py instead
    * qareviewer.py: Change fedora-* file names to qa-assistant* files
    * glade/fedora-qareviewer.glade, glade/fedora-qareviewer.gladep,

    * pixmaps, pixmaps/qa-icon.xcf, pixmaps/qa-icon.png: icon file for QA
      Assistant
    * properties.py: Initial work on a properties class to keep properties
      for the review
    * review.py: Initial, non-working start on the review widget.  May implement
      as a glade custom widget
    * PREFERENCES: split into preferences/properties
    * qareviewer.py: add SRPM and Properties code
      - Reorganized the method ordering to be more logical
      - Added docstrings for all completed methods
      - Small reworking of logic in resolution_changed
      - Implement Not Yet Implemented dialog for every menu item that's not yet
        working
    * TODO: Reorganized
    * SRPM.py: Initial work at an SRPM class to track the SRPM associated with
      the Review.  Works just barely.  Currently uses a system call to
      fedora-unrpm for part of its work and unrpms to a directory without
      being able to deal with that directory already existing.
    * glade/fedora-qareviewer.strings glade/fedora-qareviewer.glade: 
      - Added icons to the windows (Note: Probably should be done within the
        program instead.)
      - Added menu entries for all the features I can think of wanting to add.

      individual checklist items

    * TODO: 
    * data/fedoraus.xml: Change from all lowercase to mixed case.
    * checklist.py, qareviewer.py, optionrenderer.py: Many changes to use my
      custom optionrenderer that simulates a combo box. 
    
2004-03-09 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r18    
    Able to switch from review view to in-list view.

2004-03-04 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r17    
    Parsing the checklist is done.  Doesn't display well or do anything yet.

    * COPYING: checkin a copy of the GPL version 2

2004-02-29 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r9    
    * fedora-qatemplate: Merge sensible things from my version of fedora-md5.
      - Update version to 0.2
      - Add --checkhdr to check whether the rpm header agrees with the
        actual MD5Sums.
      - Redo the argument parsing because the old version only worked by
        accident.
      - Rework hash_file/hash_directory to output a hash rather than writing
        to an opened filehandle.
      - New functions get_hashes_from_rpm and perform_header_check to verify
        the RPM header MD5's against the actual md5s
    
2004-02-29 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r8

2004-02-07 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r1
