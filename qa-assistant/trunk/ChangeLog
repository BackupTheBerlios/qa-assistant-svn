2004-11-27 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r142    
    * glade/qa-assistant.glade, glade/qa-assistant.strings: Add entry to give
      the path to gpg.
    * qa-assistant.schemas: Add an entry files/gpg-path to store the path to
      gpg.
    * BUGS: Remove note that display tooltip wait syncs too much as this is
      now fixed.
    * src/preferences.py: Connect to the description wait timeout spinbutton's
      focus-out-event signal instead of value-changed.  The value-changed
      method causes us to set the gconf preference several times per change.
      focus-out only changes it once.
      - Add the Rev and Id keyword expansions.
    
2004-11-26 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r141    
    * src/optionrenderer.py:
      - Removed some old commented out code
      - Set optionlist and selectedoption gproperties to empty list and string
        on init respectively.
      - alert_changes(): pass in the oldValue of the row rather than getting it
        from the selectedoption property.  For some reason selectedoption is
        'Needs-Reviewing' when we run through here, leading to too many sets
        of the resolution in our checklist.
      - display_options(): send the proper value of selectedoption to
        alert_changes() from here.
    * src/preferences.py: New preferences dialog instantiated from glade.
      Callback code and initialization into a dialog widget here.
      - Much of the setting of gconf values is done but a little bit remains.
        The largest problem is that gpg support has to be added in.
    * src/checkview.py:
      - Make checklist an optional argument  to __init__().
    * src/checklist.py:
      - Fix noAutoDisplay; it needed parans to make the logic correct.
      - Fix getting colors from gconf.  Before, we could fail if there wasn't
        a string in the gconf value.
      - Use default values from the gconf schema if the writable gconf values
        are broken.
    * src/qareviewer.py:
      - Rearrange menu callbacks to match what we see in the menus.
      - Enable the on_menu_preferences_activate() callback to popup our new
        preferences dialog.
    * src/checkload.py: Add a way to get at the properties page of the druid.
      Probably going to change this to make a separate, embeddable properties
      widget that is a view on the checklist model.  Then I can embed it in the
      druid or embed it in a dialog window for the properties menu item.
    * BUGS:
      - Note I have to watch stale gconf keys in my local cache when testing
        after development.
      - Note to try to fix wait time on tooltip display preference syncing so
        it doesn't happen so often.
    * PREFERENCES:
      - gconf schema completed.
      - Coding and pref dialog aspect are nearly ready.
      - Note in properties section why we can't implement properties as
        gobject properties on the checklist.
    * TODO:
      - Notes on how the QA Functions menu might be taken care of.
      - Note that paths.py.pyin might be used to make testing an uninstalled
        installation work.
    * glade/qa-assistant.strings, glade/qa-assistant.glade:
      - New PreferencesDialog code.
      - Removed BugzillaDialog code.

2004-11-08 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r136    
    * qa-assistant.schemas: Change keynames to have a hierarchy within the
      apps/qa-assistant space.  Currently we have the following sections:
      user, display, and file.
    * checklist.py: Use the new schema key names.
    * BUGS: Save method has been fixed.
    * data/softwarerelease.xml: New checklist to see if a software package is

    * Ignore qaconst.py as it is generated from qaconst.py.in
    * optionrenderer.py:
      - Remove the string module as it's not used.
      - Change setattrs and getattrs that don't use variables to direct
        attribute references.
    * review.py:
      - Remove the gobject module as it's not used.
      - Rename sum variable to summary as sum is a python builtin.
    * checklist.py:
      - Change comparison to False to a not comparison per pychecker suggestion.
      - Fix a reference to a node variable that should be propChild.
      - Remove logic that sets outputList to itself as it's pretty useless.
      - Do not keep a reference to summary XML node as it's never used.
      - Do not keep a reference to value XML node as it's never used.
      - Fix mistake in publish where we need to use self.filename instead of
        the passed in filename so that qareiwer's save (as opposed to save as)
        works.
      - Moved return statement for __change_color() to the end of the function.
      - Do not keep a reference to description XML node as it's never used.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Get rid of startLabel.
      - Get rid of __check_readiness()
      - Popup a warning dialog when we are unable to save a file.
    * treetips.py: In __paint_window(), use the passed in window instead of
      self.tip_window.
    * ChangeLog: Update to (r134).
    * gnomeglade.py:
      - Rename list variable to widgetList to not override python builtin.
      - Rename dir variable to directory to not override python builtin.
    * srpmqa.py: Add __check_readiness() from qareviewer.py until we know if
      we're going to need the code there or not.
    * checkview.py: Spelling correction in docstring.
    * checkload.py:
      - Set the window title depending on how we're using the druid.
      - Dummy properties page so people don't wonder what the empty page
        is for.
      - Fix the selector page checker to catch when the user did not select a
        checklist at all.
      - Set keywords Id and Rev.
    * TODO: Notes on what needs to change on the pygtk-2.4 update.
    * glade/qa-assistant.strings, glade/qa-assistant.glade:
      - Remove the new menu as we use the druid to handle selecting a
        new checklist and then filling in the new property values instead
        of loading the property values directly.
      - Remove startLabel as we don't use it anymore.
      - Remove the druid as it's all being done programmatically.
    
2004-11-06 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r134    
    * checklist.py:
      - Change long lines of strings to not use the '\' character as strings
        can simply merge after they've spanned a line.
      - Add read and write for summary information.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Make sure all instantiations of the druid also show() it.
      - Write a new on_menu_new_activate() handler to use the druid to load a
        new checklist.  Willl have to work on glade files as well.
      - Simplify on_menu_open_activate() down to a call to the druid as the
        rest of the logic is now part of the druid.
      - Point on_toolbar_new_activate() at the menu equivalent instead of
        popping up a new1_menu.  need to remove that menu from glade as well.
    * error.py: Use a call to Exception's __init__() to create the self.args
      tuple.
    * checkload.py:
      - Remove gnomeglade import as its not needed.
      - Private constants for the selector's treeview.
      - Recode the saving of checklist Filenames in the selector to use full
        path information.
      - Move the end page creation into its own build_end() function.
      - There's now a loader_next() method; set propBackPage there instead of
        __init__().
      - Get a reference to the selector's gtk.TreeSelection so we can find out
        which CheckList file was picked.
      - New function: finish() that saves the loaded checklist into the app.
    
2004-11-06 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r133    
    * checklist.py: Comment out do_resolution_changed().  We don't seem to have
      any use for it yet.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Remove properties as we're nearly done converting to GConf.
      - Save a reference to the logo pixbuf.
      - Remove all commandline parsing for now.
      - Move startlabel initialization into __init__()
      - Copious notes on implementing the druid.
      - Call to start the druid on program start.
      - Remove SRPM_into_properties as this whole thing is getting revamped.
    * PREFERENCES:
      - Add Druid info.
      - Add function info.
      - Note other things that get set with checklist specific information.
    * configure.ac: Change the version to 0.4.90.1 -- a development release.
    * data/checklist.dtd: Add summary tag which briefly describes the purpose
      of the checklist.
    * data/fedoraus.xml: Add summary tag.
    * NEWS: Changed to version 0.4.90.1.  Big note that it's a development
      release.
    * error.py: Gave my base Error class an __init__ to place the msg into a
      standard attribute.
    * srpmqa.py: Add SRPM_into_properties here.  It is just copied verbatim
      from qareviewer.py and doesn't do anything useful.  But it may have
      useful code that we want to hang onto.
    * README: Note that 0.5 final will require pygtk-2.4.0 rather than 2.2.0
    * checkload.py: New file that instantiates a Druid to get information
      from the user for loading new and saved checklists.
    
2004-10-24 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r132    
    * PREFERENCES: Add a section on Functions.  Functions and properties remain
      to be architected and then implemented.
    * tests/test.py: Needed to add the parent directory to the python path to
      allow makedistcheck to detect the built python files in the builddir
      rather than the ones in the srcdir.
    * ChangeLog: Update to (r131)
    * gnomeglade.py: Update from using the deprecate gtk.mainloop() to
      gtk.main()
    * README: Add ReStructuredText markup to list webpages for QA Assistant's
      requirements.
    
2004-10-23 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r131    
    * qa-assistant.schemas: Rename key: show-checklist-descriptions ->
      disable-checklist-descriptions because gconf returns false when a value
      is unset so that makes a better default. 
    * checklist.py: Use qaconst to import program-wide constants
      (specifically GCONFPREFIX).
    * qareviewer.py: Use qaconst to import program-wide constants. As part
      of this, rename __programName -> PROGRAMNAME, and __programHumanName__ ->
      HUMANPROGRAMNAME.
    * PREFERENCES: Files and signing preferences are left to do.
    * configure.ac: Add qaconst.py to the list of files to generate.
    * properties.py: Remove properties that are now generated from gconf.
    * genericqa.py: Use app.lastReviewDir instead of properties.lastReviewDir.
    * treetips.py: Change the maximum timeout for treetips from one second to
      one minute.
    * checkview.py:
      - Import program-wide constants from qaconst.
      - Use gconf to set preferences on displaying the treetip help text.
        + New function: __change_treetip_show() to toggle displaying the help
          on and off.
        + New function: __change_treetip_delay() to change how long the mouse
          must hover before the tip pops up.
      - Remove executable from the checkview.  Set Id and Rev keywords.
    * qaconst.py.in: New file to hold program wide constants.
    * Makefile.am: Add qaconst.py.in to the files.
    
2004-10-21 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r130    
    * review.py:
      - Merged the self.*Title variables that held gtk.Labels for the various
        resolution categories into a self.reviewTitles dict.  This makes
        iteration over it match with self.reviewBoxes and lends itself to
        implementing customized headings for these labels.
      - Rewrote the publish() method to function with the new widget internals.
        This is not complete as CheckList still has to export data regarding
        what the header should look like but it does publish a savefile that
        is somewhat helpful.  (As opposed to being miserably broken before.)
    * BUGS: Note to try optimizing away CheckList.set() calls.
    * PREFERENCES: Note which objects the remaining preferences may be
      implemented within.
    * NEWS: Add note about the new Review widget.
    * genericqa.py: Check the checklist's resolution to decide whether its
      ready to publish or not instead of Review.
    * ChangeLog: Update to (r129)
    
2004-10-21 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r129    
    * review.py: Minor reformatting to fit in 80 columns.
    * qa-assistant.schemas: Rename auto-display-failed key to no-auto-display
      so that having it unset or the default value of false triggers the
      auto-displaying of negative entries.  This is because gconf defaults to
      false when a bool is unset.
    * checklist.py:
      - Remove addPaths as we don't use it anymore.
      - New Private var __GCONFPREFIX for the app prefix.
      - Comment variables in __init__().
      - New self.colors dict to keep track of thecolors we're setting via
        gconf.
      - Load the colors from gconf.
      - Decide whether to autoDisplay on negative reviews from gconf.
      - Start moving from using self.set to gtk.TreeStore.set when we can as
        self.set is much more expensive than gtk.TreeStore.set.
      - Change all OUTPUT strings from None to empty string.
      - Put pangoize into self.set().  Remove it from all other calls.
      - Pangoize a string when it goes into OUTPUT, not into OUTPUTLIST.
      - Get rid of do_resolution_changed's print.  We may get rid of this
        altogether.  I think everything we'd put in here is now being done
        in the set() method.
      - set() method reworked to assure resolution happens before OUTPUT and
        pangoize happens before the set is done.  The whole set() method
        feels significantly slower than gtk.TreeStore.set().  We need to
        use the base class method when possible instead of self.set().
      - New function: __change_auto_display() to handle auto display on fail
        being changed in gconf.
      - New function: __init_colors() to initialize colors from gconf.
      - New function: __color_changed() to change colors when changed in
        gconf.
      - New function: __change_color() to change the colors of displayed
        OUTPUT strings when the colors are changed in gconf.
    * qareviewer.py: Change references to last*Dir from using a properties
      class to storing as a variable in the QAReviewer class.  Preparatory
      to getting rid of Properties altogether.
    * PREFERENCES: Go into more detail abo9ut what needs to be done and check
      off the ones that have been finished.
    * NEWS: Add gconf note.  Move cut 'n paste to 0.4.1.
    * genericqa.py: Remove call to pangoize.

      error.

      module.
    * qa-assistant.spec.in: Correct a syntax error in the spec and update the
      changelog.

    * PREFERENCES: Expand upon what we're doing with preferences and GConf
      now that I'm writing the code.
    * tests/testtreetips.py:
      - Create treetips with an actual TreeView and TreeModel.

      constructor.
    * Makefile.am: Add the GConf schema.
    * glade/qa-assistant.strings, glade/qa-asistant.glade:
      - Begin work on a preferences dialog.

2004-10-13 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r122    
    * review.py: Set labels to be selectable so we can use clipboards to copy
      from them. In the future we'll have to work out editing as well.
    * BUGS: Move checklist load to Needs Testing.
    * qareviewer.py, properties.py: Properties is steadily getting eaten away.
      Remove the need to store the checklist filename there.
    * qareviewer.py: Code to Cut/copy/paste is now in.
    * NEWS: Note that cut and paste should now work.
    * ChangeLog: Update to r121
    * glade/qa-assistant.glade: Remove the Edit::Clear menu item.  It's a bit
      ambiguous as to what it means.  Functionality probably already exists.
    
2004-10-08 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r121    
    * review.py:
      - Allow a new Review to be created without specifying a CheckList.
      - BugFix: set newly created labels to use pango markup.
      - BugFix: attempt to remove the VBox widgets from self.reviewBoxes
        instead of their names.
    * BUGS: Noticed that save_as works, but save does not.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Stop loading checklist on startup.  Yay!
      - Create CheckView and Review on startup and add them to our window.
      - Get rid of the hacks that destroyed and recreated CheckView and Review
        widgets when loading a new checklist.  We can now do this with a simple
        set_model() call.
      - Make sure we're show()'ing the checkView when we load a new CheckList.
      - Get rid of pygtk 2.0 bug work around.
    * ChangeLog: update to (r120)
    * checkview.py: Rename a variable from checklist to cl to fix problem
      where I was bashing the checklist namespace.
    
2004-10-08 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r120    
    * review.py:
      - Note that publish doesn't work.
      - Revert CheckList constants back to module level.
      - Remove __resolution_check() as it's now implemented in the checklist.
    * checklist.py:
      - Revert CheckList constants back to module level.
      - Add more values to __Property.
      - Fixes to load and save the new, complex properties from the XML file.
      - Fixes to load and save the more complex functions from the XML file.
      - Add code to __init__() to figure out the category and checklist
        resolutions on load.  A lot of commonality with __check_resolution().
        Look into merging.
      - Rename check_category_resolution to __check_resolution.
      - Simplify logic in __check_resolution to use else instead of elif.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Create the CheckView before loading the CheckList.
      - Use CheckView.set_model to set to the new CheckList instead of detroying
        the CheckView and recreating it.
      - Remove self.properties from a call to create a Review().
    * ChangeLog: Update to (r119)
    * checkview.py: Made resolution_changed a single line.
    
2004-10-07 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r119    
    * checklist.py:
      - Create a resolution attribute that holds the CheckList's resolution.
      - Note about workarounds because we can't add custom gproperties.
      - Create a resolution-changed signal that is emitted when the CheckList
        resolution is changed.
      - Temporary do_resolution_changed() signal handler.  Doesn't do anything
        yet.  We may not need to do anything with it.
      - set() method that overrides the gtk.TreeStore set method.  We have to
        do this so we can find out if any rows have had their RESOLUTION
        changed.  If so, we decide if we should update the category and
        CheckList resolutions as well.
      - check_category_resolution():
        + now works for both categories and the CheckList's resolution.
        + No longer sets any values except the resolution.  These other parts
          are done in the self.set() method.
        + Check whether the category is already set to Needs-Reviewing so we
          don't set it unnecessarily.
    * checkview.py: Remove call to check_category_resolution().  This is
      managed entirely by the CheckList now.
    
2004-10-04 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r118    
    * review.py: Set line wrapping in the labels showing the review items.
    * tests/test.py: Add treetips to the complement of tests.
    * tests/testtreetips.py: A set of tests for the treetips module.
    * tests/Makefile.am: Add treetips to the complement of tests.
    * treetips.py: Fix a syntax error when checking which property we need
      to set.
    * ChangeLog: Update to (r117).
    
2004-10-03 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r117    
    * review.py:
      - Check that we're being passed a CheckList type.
      - Use gtk.VBox.__init__ instead of GObject.__init__.
      - No longer use gobject.type_register() because we don't define our
        own __gproperties__.
    * checklist.py:
      - A beginning for signal addition.
      - Remove set_output_string()
    * tests/testcreation.py:
      - Add tests for the Review widget.
      - Push CheckView creation back to normal precedence.  Our reimplemented
        TreeTips don't depend on CheckView but CheckView does depend on
        TreeTips.
      - Create two more success tries as treetips should now take a normal
        gtk.TreeView and No arguments whatsoever.
      - Push TreeTips precedence up as it is needed for CheckView.
      - Failure test now looks for TypeError as we check that the widget
        supports our needed signals rather than explicit types.
    * treetips.py:
      - Remove random numbers.  We should be able to get timeout IDs from a
        simple counter (self.unique) instead.
      - Add many __gproperties__ supported by gtk.Tooltips.
      - Add view and column __gproperties__ for the treeview and column that
        we draw our data from.
      - Make __init__ able to handle the no argument case.
      - Remove check for whether we're passed a gtk.TreeView.  Instead, we
        check if we get an object with the proper __gsignals__.
      - Rename some internal variables to use the publicly available
        __gproperties__ names instead.
      - Add self.enable() and self.disable() methods to mirror Tooltips.
      - do_get_property() and do_set_property() methods to work with the
        __gproperties__.
      - Using the self.enabled gproperty, it should now be possible to turn
        treetips off.
      - gobject.type_register() as we now define our own __gproperties__.
    
2004-10-01 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r115    
    * ChangeLog: Update to r114
    * genericqa.py: Fix one place where we were setting the outputList to
      none values instead of empty string.
    
2004-10-01 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r114    
    * Warning: This commit should display the checklist on the screen fine but
      will not publish a review to file.  It also will not display any header
      information associated with SRPM reviews.  Anything that was broken
      before is likely to still be broken now.  On the plus side, this is
      probably the most broken the package will get for a while.  The major
      architectural changes are done for the next version.  There is a great
      deal to do, but should be mostly rewriting older features to work within
      the new design.
    * ChangeLog: Update to r113
    * review.py: Major rewrite of the Review widget.  Display is mostly
      finished but publish does not work and some more reworking of the
      interaction with the CheckList/checklist file is needed.
      - Removed re and string as functions using them are now in CheckList.
      - Remove MyRendererText.  The new Review widget does not use a ListView
        so it doesn't need a custom Cell Renderer.
      - Remove listview positional constants.
      - __init__ no longer creates self.properties or takes a properties
        argument.  All operations on the SRPM (which we got from properties)
        will now be done in a header creation function in the checklist.
      - Remove self.addPaths and __add_data as the functionality has been
        merged into __update_data.
      - resolution and hashLabel are replaced with a header label which will
        be set from a property on the CheckList.
      - The four gtk.ListViews have been replaced with a reviewBoxes dict
        that holds four gtk.VBoxes.
      - Remove update_hash and __update_hash as hashes become the
        responsibility of the CheckList.
      - set_model() method to set a data model for the Review to view.
      - __sync_checklist() method to sync the Review to a new CheckList.
        This replaces and extends __generate_data.
      - Significant rewrite of __update_data() using the new
          self.entries[SUMMARY] = (RESOLUTION, unique number) and
          self.displayList[(RESOLUTION, unique number)] = label and
          self.reviewBoxes[RESOLUTION] = label
        datastructures.  This has the side effect of incorporating the logic
        for new CheckList entries entirely into this function.
      - Remove __filter_good, __filter_work, __filter_minor, __filter_note as
        we aren't using Cell Renderers anymore so we don't have to create
        arcane callbacks to transform our data before passing to them for
        display.
      - Note that most of __resolution_check's functionality is going to be
        merged into the checklist.
    * checklist.py:
      - Set values for outputList to the empty string rather than None.  This
        works with the new Review widget better.
      - Note that check_category_resolution is going to undergo a major
        overhaul.
    * qareviewer.py: Remove calls to Review.update_hash.
    * tests: ignore Makefile, Makefile.in and *.pyc files.
    * tests/Makefile.am: Add *.pyc and *.pyo files to the CLEANFILES.
    
2004-09-27 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r113    
    * tests/testchecklist.py, tests/testcreation.py:
      - Make this a runnable script so we can run the checklist tests as a
        subset of the complete suite.
      - Now import the local test module to get path information and other
        things global to all tests.
      - Change naming format from test* to test[0-9]*_*.  This allows us to
        define priorities for our tests.
      - Make suite a toplevel function instead of a method so it's easily
        callable by external programs.
      - Call our own suite function to create the test suite.  Also check the
        results to give a proper return code on exit.
      - Add Rev, Id, and Date substitution.
    * tests/testcreation.py:
      - Add tests for TreeTips and CheckView.
      - Change detection of classes from a string test on the type to calls
        to isinstance().
    * tests/test.py:
      - Check for the existence of srcdir environment variable before running
        the test.  If it's available we use it to enable VPATH builds.
        Otherwise default to using modules relative to the current directories.
      - Use the suite functions of the test* modules to create the test suites.
      - Add Rev, Id, and Date substitution.
    * tests/Makefile.am: Change from running test.py to invoke all tests to
      the two test modules individually.  Not sure if this is more desirable or
      not.  Will try for a while and see.
      - Add Rev, Id, and Date substitution.
    * autogen.sh: Change from using the auto* tools individually to using
      autoreconf as suggestied in the autoconf info pages.
    * treetips.py: Check that the treeview argument to the TreeTips is a
      gtk.TreeView.
    * ChangeLog:
      - Update to r112.
      - Fix some spelling and formatting errors.
    * TODO: Add a note to finish the unittests.
    
2004-09-24 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r112    
    * tests, tests/testchecklist.py, test.py, tests/Makefile.am,
      tests/testcreation.py, configure.ac, Makefile.am: The tests directory
      holds unittests for QA Assistant.  Currently, there are two in-progress
      modules: One that tests creation of new objects.  A second that tests
      the functioning of checklist objects.
    
2004-09-24 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r111    
    * checklist.py: Correct a syntax error in our lowercasing of entries for
      duplication checking that our unittesting framework caught.  Need to
      start working on merging unittests into the program's build.
    
2004-09-24 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r110    
    * Warning: Untested.  Probably broken.  Basic changes to the data format.
    * checklist.py: Bugfix: When checking for duplicate entries, ignore case
      as we probably want to consider "Parts Move", "Parts move", and
      "parts move" as duplicates of each other.
    * BUGS: Move the duplicate entries bug to testing.
    * data/checklist.dtd:
      - Add file to the allowed PropType's.  I was going to rely on file URL
        but have decided a file type makes it easier to know when to open a
        file selection dialog.
      - Add FuntionType that tells where a function is to be used.
      - Add RequireType that tells at what point a Property needs to be known.
      - Restructure property element to hold a function that can select the
        property's value.
    * data/fedoraus.xml:
      - Use the new function information for properties.
      - Add type information to functions.

    * AUTHORS, BUGS, PREFERENCES, NEWS, README, TODO: Small formatting fixes
      to make the files ReStructuredText compliant.  I can now transform them
      all with rst2html to make HTML documentation.
    * qareviewer.py: Remove 'None' from a conditional.
    * ChangeLog: Update to r108
    
2004-09-17 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r108    
    * checklist.py:
      - Removed __added_row from handling __row-inserted signals and
        __modified_row from row-changed.  Migrate functionality into
        add_entry().
      - add_entry() no longer returns an iter to the new entry as using
        the iter is taken care of in add_entry().
      - Fix exception name DuplicateItem instead of DuplicateItemError.
      - Fix problem in check_category_resolution() where an iter variable
        was split into two when it was renamed.
    * BUGS:
      - Move five bugs into the fixed/testing category.
      - Add note to make duplicate item entry case insensitive.
    * genericqa.py:
      - The CheckList is now responsible for setting the entries dict.
        Remove the code from here that did that.
      - Fix exception name DuplicateItem.
    
2004-09-17 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r107    
    * Warning:  This is another known broken commit.
    * Subversion property mergelog updated to reflect merge from the current
      0.4 branch.
    * qaconvert.py: File renamed qa-convert.pyin.
    * checklist.py:
      - Copied the gtk.TreeModel constants back out to the module level.
        Have to decide if it makes more sense to be at the module or class
        level.
      - Throw an exception if the user specified checklist isn't an XML file.
      - When loading a checklist savefile, change the revision to an integer.
      - Note to see what happens if we move the row-inserted and row-changed
        signal handler functionality into the add_entry function.
      - Move check_category_resolution method into CheckList from qareviewer.
        Should be ported, but still needs to be called by the CheckList when
        we open a savefile.
    * BUGS: List of known bugs.  Currently very long.  Helps inform of what
      is known to be broken in the current checkin.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Move CheckList display into CheckView.py.
      - Create a CheckView object to take its place.
    * configure.ac: Change the checklist DTD path to version 0.3
    * data/checklist.dtd: Lowercase the "url" proptype.
    * data/fedoraus.xml: Change ticketURL from type string to "url"

      - Note that checklist is no longer tied to SRPM QA.
      - Merge note that distuninstallcheck was fixed in 0.4.1 (r106)
    * properties.py: Remove bugzillaURL and bugzillaNumber as the code now
      uses in XML properties.
    * genericqa.py:
      - Use the error module to get the exception values.
      - Remove the resolution_changed call from here.  Need to test whether
        it works automatically in CheckList/CheckView interaction or if we'll
        need to write some code to handle this.
    * qa-convert.pyin: Renamed from qaconvert.py.  This is now a toplevel
      program that will convert from qasave 0.1 format to checklist 0.3.
    * checkview.py: Functionality moved from qareviewer.py to display a
      checklist.  Reimplemented as a subclass of gtk.TreeView.
    * TODO: Save and load buttons for toolbar is done.
    * Makefile.am:
      - Add the qa-convert script as a build target.
      - Add checkview.py and error.py and removed savefile.py from the
        qa-assistant files.
      - Add qa-convert.pyin to the EXTRA_DIST
      - Overrode the default distuninstallcheck_listfiles to not error on
        the XML catalogs.  From 0.4 branch (r106)
    
2004-09-16 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r105    
    * savefile.py: Rename to qaconvert.py
    * qaconvert.py: Conversion to a script that can read in qasave 0.1 files
      and output checklist 0.3 files.
      - Changes to allow running as a standalone script
      - Rename base class from SaveFile to QAConverter
      - Now a subclass of CheckList
      - load(): The new __init__().
        Changes to initialize an 0.3 format checklist, layer the qasave 0.1
        on top, and still have a valid 0.3 format checklist in memory.
      - Removed pieces related to saving.  We're only loading this format.
        Saves take place as an 0.3 CheckList.
      - Changes to use the CheckList attributes and publish function to output
        a correct 0.3 checklist file.
    
2004-09-10 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r104    
    * Note: Saving and loading checklists should now work entirely with the
      new code.  There are still some known cosmetic bugs but they are
      being worked on as part of the next phase of rewriting.
    * checklist.py:
      - Create __Property class to save property information.
      - Bugfix: Save and load property type information.
      - Bugfix: Use the saved value for resolution instead of the default
        'Needs-Reviewing' when loading a checklist.
      - Bugfix: Whether to display a checklist item in the output was being
        set backwards.  Fixed.
    * qareviewer.py: New plan for moving the category resolution code after
      we abstract the CheckView code.
    
2004-09-08 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r103    
    * This revision is known to not create valid savefiles.
    * genericqa.py: Remove the checklist import as it's not needed here.
    * checklist.py:
      - Move treeModel constants into the CheckList class instead of the
        module level.
      - Many conversions of treeModel constants to reference inside the
        class instead of at the module level.
      - __init__(): Bugfix properties and functions weren't being extracted
        from the XML file at all.  This gets them loaded in except for one
        issue with properties not loading the type attribute.
      - publish(): Bugfix revision needs to be converted to a string before
        being saved into the XML.
      - Change function output to use newTextChild() instead of newChild().
      - unpangoize_output(): Bugfix span tag is now removed properly.
      - __xml_to_entry(): Bugfix: the script telling users that an automated
        test was unable to run needed to specify None for the language
        versions.
    * review.py:
      - Update the checklist treeModel field constants to reference those
        saved inside the checklist rather than at the module level.
      - Bugfix indentation problem from iter fixups.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Import the CheckList class from the checklist instead of the whole
        module.
      - Convert from SaveFile to CheckList.
      - Update the checklist treeModel constants to reference those saved
        inside the checklist rather than at the module level.
    
2004-09-08 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r102    
    * treetips.py, optionrenderer.py, review.py, qareviewer.py: Rename all
      variables named iter as it's the name of a python builtin and it's
      not that descriptive of what's actually being operated on.
    * ChangeLog: Update to r101
    
2004-09-08 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r101    
    * NEWS: Really add notes about updated DTD and support for automated tests.
    
2004-09-08 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r100    
    * Warning: This revision is likely to contain bugs.  Possibly serious
      bugs.  The checklist dtd and checklist.py has been updated to a new
      checklist format but the code in savefile.py hasn't.  savefile.py is
      being phased out in development in favour of the new checklist code.
      The main app has not yet been ported over to this code so some parts
      are using the new checklist and others are using the old savefile.
      The design of QA Assistant means the old and new pieces should be
      insulated from each other but this isn't guaranteed.
    * error.py:
      - Add CannotAccessFile exception for when accessing a given filename
        doesn't work.
      - Remove InvalidSaveFile as the savefile format is going away.
    * genericqa.py: Use new checklist pangoize_output() function.
    * savefile.py: Use pangoize_output() and unpangoize_output when loading
      and saving information to the XML files.
    * review.py:
      - Set the checklist in the __init__ method.  This is in preparation
        for making Review into a gtk.TreeView subclass.
      - Use unpangoize_output() when printing a review.
    * checklist.py:
      - Rename _checklistFileVersion_ to formatVersion and move it inside
        the checklist class.
      - Remove MODIFIED from the TreeStore entries.
      - Added TEST to the TreeStore entries.
      - Moved Exceptions to the error module.
      - More thorough documentation of the CheckList class.
      - Define publicID and canonicalURL strings for the checklist.
      - Create a __Test private class for information on the automated
        tests that might be included in the XML file.
      - Create self.functions and self.properties from the XML savefile
        nodes of the same name.
      - Save the filename too.
      - Change exception names to be uppercase word start since exceptions
        are classes.
      - Remove checklist "type" attribute as the prop is we're moving to
        use "functions" instead.
      - Code to extract the base element from the checklist.
      - Rename all variables named "iter" as that's a python builtin.
      - Convert from colorize_output() to pangoize_output().
      - New function publish() from the savefile.  Writes the modified
        checklist out to a file.  Many changes over the publish function
        in savefile to write a checklist 0.3 format instead of qasave 0.1.
      - Rename colorize_output() to pangoize_output().
      - New function unpangoize_output() provides the reverse of pangoize.
        It removes pango markup and make entity substitution for &, < , >.
      - In __xml_to_entry(), extract the test information as well.
      - New function __create_entry() from savefile.  Heavily modified to
        make a checklist 0.3 instead of qasave 0.1 entry.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Use error module for checklist exceptions.
      - Disable checklist.type checking as that's being replaced by the
        checklist.functions functionality.
      - Utilize pangoize_output() to make output strings ready for display.
    * data/checklist.dtd: Work on version 0.3
      - New PUBLIC and SYSTEM IDs.
      - Comment everything.
      - Remove Checklist type.
      - Merge necessary qasasve data such as base and property.
      - Add function element to hold information on what additional
        abilities the checklist wants added to the QA Actions.
      - Add test element to hold information for running automated tests.
    * data/fedoraus.xml: Update to checklist.dtd 0.3
    * NEWS: Add notes about updated DTD and support for automated tests.

    * error.py: New program wide error module to define exceptions.
    
2004-08-25 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r97    
    * checklist.py:
      - Make CheckList be a subclass of gtk.TreeStore.
      - Get rid of the tree attribute as its functionality is now
        implemented by the class itself.
      - Switch to a program wide error module for defining exceptions
        instead of in-module.
      - Get rid of the props. attribute because properties are only used
        to define the output colors and those are moving into GConf.
    * qareviewer.py, savefile.py: CheckList is now a subclass of
      gtk.TreeStore so invoke the TreeStore methods directly on it instead
      of a tree that it holds.
    * review.py: Rename variable tree references to treeStore as it's more
      appropriate.
    * NEWS: Note that the CheckList is now a subclass of gtk.TreeStore.

    * savefile.py: Add a reference to the application so we can
      use locate_file().
    * qareviewer.py: Move savefile initialization after GnomeApp creation
      so we can use it there.
    
2004-08-03 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r87    
    * savefile.py: import gnome because we're using gnome.program_get()
      to get the gnome app to use locate_file with.
    
2004-08-03 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r86    
    * properties.py: Remove the saveDTD from properties.
    * genericqa.py:
      - Create resList and outputList for allowable resolutions.
      - Use resList to create the resolutions in the Option Box.
      - Use return value from checklist.add_entry() to set Custom Item
        resolution.
    * savefile.py:
      - Remove DTD path as it's all done with catalogs now.
      - Unescape <, >, & before saving.
      - Change back to GnomeApp.program.locate_file()
    * gnomeglade.py: Move locate_file() back into the GnomeApp class.
      When locate_file() makes its way into pygtk it's going to be a
      method of GnomeProgram.
    * checklist.py:
      - duplicateItemError: New exception used when attempting to add an
        item that is already allocated.
      - add_entry(): returns an iter to the new entry.  not sure if this
        should be a permanent part of the API or just a quick hack to get
        resolution changing working.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Remove all the DTD handling stuff as it's now done with xml catalogs
        instead.
      - Change back to GnomeApp.program.locate_file().
      - Note that resolution_changed should probably move to the checklist.
      - Reset the savefile name to None when we load a new SRPM so we don't
        accidentally overwrite a different saved review.
    * TODO: Note to look into salvaging uninstalled_file lookups.
    * SRPM.py: Catch IOError when opening the SRPM fails.  Then we can spit
      an error about the file being inaccessible.
    * Makefile.am: Remove the dtd's name from rewriteSystem and rewriteURI
      as those methods add the dtd filename themselves.

    * savefile.py:
      - set_checklist(): method to set the checklist whenever it changes.
        dirty hack that will go away when we merge with checklist as we'll
        then be able to reference `self`.
      - __xml_to_entry(): Fix the Output List to be a dict rather than a list.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - __init__(): Create saveFile before checklist so that __load_checklist
        can access the saveFile.
      - Remove the TreeModel from the arguments to the output_edited callback
        because arguments passed in are set at definition time, not runtime,
        leading to stale data.
      - on_menu_open_activate(): Make sure we destroy the old checklist
        before creating a new one.
      - on_menu_open_activate(): Ditto for reviewView

      - Sync the view of the checklist when we load a save file. (r77)
      - Move the menu save handler to mirror menu placement. (r77)
      - Move creation of the Review widget to __load_checklist(). (r78)
      - Revert workaround for gtk.menu.popup time bug as it's fixed in
        pygtk-2.2.0. (r78)
      - Loading a new review from SRPM now calls __load_checklist(). (r78)
      - Create an open menu callback to load a save file. It has copies
        of code in __load_checklist to work so cleanup is necessary. (r78)

      are resolution changes that affect the review as a whole.
    * qareviewer.py:

      - Fix looking for properties.checklist (filename) instead of
        checklistName (symbolic name)
      - Remove the publish callback as it's now in genericqa.py
      - Create on_menu_save_as_activate modeled on genericqa.py:publish
        (review).
      - Rearrange things with the FileSelectDialog when loading an SRPM to
        run as little as possible under the try:finally: block.
    * TODO: Note that libxml2 has some guidelines for good xml definitions
      that we need to look at.

    * NEWS: Add saving and loading to the new features.
    
2004-04-29 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r71    
    * genericqa.py: Add Rev and Id keyword expansion.
    * treetips.py: Add Rev and Id keyword expansion.
    * review.py: Bugfix ListStore.append takes a tuple, not a straight sequence
      of values.
    * srpmqa.py: Add Rev and Id keyword expansion.
    * checklist.py: Beginning of changes to allow Saving of work.
      - Add a MODIFIED entry to the tree.
      - self.addPaths hash to alert us that an entry is being added.
      - __modified_row and __added_row replace broken __add_entry_to_lookup
      - __modified_row: new function
        + Sets the MODIFIED flag on the row.
        + Adds new entries to the entries hash for quick lookup of existing
          checklist items.
      - __added_row: New function
        + Sets MODIFIED flag on a new row so it gets saved.
        + Adds the row path to addPaths so __modified_row can add it when the
          SUMMARY information becomes available.
    * data/checklist.dtd: Use ENTITY for Enumerated values.
    * data/qasave.dtd: New dtd that defines a savefile.
    * data/sample-save.xml: A sample savefile.
    * Makefile.am: Move comments on the install-data-hook above the definition
      to make it more portable.
    
2004-04-29 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r70    
    * genericqa.py:
      - Add an attribute to cache the path where we add custom checklist items.
      - Use the customItemsPath attribute instead of searching.
      - Don't emit the row-inserted signal manually, gtk takes care of it
        automatically.
    * review.py:
      - Add an attribute to cache items being added.
      - Stop using self.tree.  It was unnecessary to hold a reference to the
        tree because it was sent to our functions whenever we needed to use
        data from it.
      - __update_data(): Now does most of the work when adding entries as well.
      - __add_data(): Functionality moved to __update_data because row-inserted
        is emitted when the row is created.  But it is created empty.  So we
        have no way to use it at that point.  New __add_data() just flags the
        treeStore's path as being added so __update_data doesn't have to
        guess that an addition is coming.
    
2004-04-27 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r69    
    * paths.py.pyin: Add Id and Rev keyword expansion.

    * genericqa.py:
      - Change the 'Add Checklist Item' mnemonic

    * checklist.py:
      - Change function names from __xmlToEntry() form to __xml_to_entry()
      - Create a new data struct 'entries' which is a map of Summary => iter.
        The immediate need was to have fast lookups of what Summary items
        appear in the checklist.  Eventually, the Review widget should also use
        this to quickly access an iter from a Summary value.
      - colorize_output: Move colorization of output to its own function.
      - __add_to_entry_lookup: New function to support the entries dict.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Rename columns 'pass/fail' and 'Description' to 'Resolution' and
        'Summary'.
      - Use checklist.colorize_output()

      - Add note about architectural changes for QA Functions
      - Remove add non-checklist items as it's finished

    * TODO: Druid on New note
    * qa-assistant.spec.in: Make the desktop install conform to Fedora Extras

2004-04-20 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r63    
    * configure.ac: Generate qa-assistant.spec
    * TODO: Spec file written

      touchups to the desktop file handling and check to make sure the URL and
      Source0 download link are correct.
    * Makefile.am:
      - Add genericqa.py and srpmqa.py to the dist scripts.
      - Remove qa-assistant from the nodist section.  It is already in the
        bin_SCRIPTS target.  Add qa-assistant manually to CLEANFILES.
      - Add the *.spec and *.spec.in to EXTRA_DIST
    * NEWS: Spec file and QA Actions menu notes.
    
2004-04-20 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r62

2004-04-19 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r61    
    * genericqa.py: A new subclass of gtk.Menu.  This represents a generic QA
      Menu with callbacks for its menu items.  Actions that can be performed
      on all QA checklists should be added here.
    * srpmqa.py: A new subclass of genericqa.py that adds menuitems and
      callbacks for actions specific to writing a review of an srpm.
    * checklist.py: Comments for each of the TreeModel field enums
    * qareviewer.py: Import the proper QA Menu code depending on the type of
      checklist we load.
    * glade/qa-assistant.glade, glade/qa-assistant.strings: Create the empty
      QA Action menu that qareviewer.py fills with a GenericQA or SRPMQA object.
    
2004-04-16 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r60    
    * review.py: Remove the formatting tags before spitting out the review
    * checklist.py: Change Needs-Reviewing output back to None as it turns out
      it wasn't necessary and broke the Review widget's publish method.
    * qareviewer.py: 
      - Popup a message dialog if the reviewer wants to publish and the review
        has a resolution of Incomplete.
      - Publish review dialog is now destroyed whether it's successful or not.
      - gtk.get_current_event_time, event.time, and menu.popup have an overflow
        bug.  event.time and menu.popup use 32Bit Python signed ints.
        get_current_event_time returns a Python Long type.  The C gtk library
        uses an Unsigned 32 bit int.  Problem should probably be fixed in the
        bindings by using Python Long for python code and coerce to C unsigned
        int when sending to the library.  My temporary work around is to munge
        the long type into an int32 that's wrapped into the negatives.
    * TODO, NEWS: Check for 'Needs-Reviewing' Resolution done.
    
2004-04-16 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r59    
    * checklist.py, qareviewer.py: Give the whole props array to the new

    * TODO: Note that textwrap is a python 2.3 method.
    
2004-04-15 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r58    
    * properties.py: Add *Color properties
    * review.py: Set the output renderers to use markup instead of text
    * checklist.py: Add color information to the output strings.  The color
      information is stored in the Properties object which is not a part of
      the checklist.  So the information is given when initializing the
      checklist.  Not ideal.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Set output renderer to use markup instead of text
      - Note about __load_checklist bug
      - Set colors when editing an output string
    * TODO: Remove colorize.  Add spec file
    * NEWS: Add colorize to the list of new features
    
2004-04-15 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r56    
    * qareviewer.py: Fix a bug where reloading the checklist causes editing of

    * Ignore files generated by autoconf/automake

2004-04-14 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r48    
    * properties.py: Uncomment bugzilla stuff although it doesn't do anything.
    * paths.py.pyin: Python file that has variables which make expands to point
      at various parts of the installation path.  This gives us access to the
      paths the user gives to configure for Gnome functions.
    * qa-assistant.desktop.in: First stab at a desktop file to put things in
      the menus.  It is a .in because intltool messes with it.  However, we
      aren't yet using that.
    * qa-assistant, qa-assistant.pyin: Moved qa-assistant to .pyin because we
      need make to append the install directory ($pkgdatadir) to the python
      import path.
    * gnomeglade.py:
      - Set the gnome PARAM_APP_* properties on the GnomeApp object using the
        configure values stored in paths.py
      - GnomeApp.__uninstalled_file(): looks for the filename in the program's
        directory.  Useful when testing the program in the build directory.
      - GnomeApp.locate_file(): simulate the libgnome function.  Look for
        files in a specified FileDomain and return a list of possibilities.
      - Use __uninstalled_file and locate_file to load the user interface.
    * README:
      - Changes for sourceforge and the fact that it can now install
      - Bump version to 0.3
    * checklist.py: Accommodate the checklist now having a type.
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Separate programName from programHumanName
      - Bump version to 0.3
      - Set gnome properties on the GnomeApp
      - Use locate_file to find the program data/pixmap/glade files.
    * configure.ac: Configure script for qa-assistant
    * data/checklist.dtd: Bump version to 0.2 and make a type attribute for
      checklist so we can load certain menus based on the checklist type.

2004-04-01 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r29    
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Only load an SRPM if one is given on the commandline.  Print a usage
        message otherwise.
      - Catch exceptions from loading the SRPM -- but don't do anything
        useful with them yet.
      - Fix the Auto-display of non-Pass items to display non-blockers as well.
    * TODO: update SRPM.py entry
    * SRPM.py:
      - Added some simple exceptions.  May need more refinement as we progress.
      - Check if the SRPM file exists and is readable instead of just if the
        file has the potential to be readable.
      - Some cleanups to how we use python file objects.
      - Reordered the functions to be somewhat more logical.  Still some work
        to be done there.
      - Check for previous unarchival of rpm.  Still needs a few problem cases
        resolved nicely.
      - Fix up the internal rpm2cpio code.  It now works with gzip compressed
        payloads.  BZ2 stuff needs python-2.3 and someone to take a look at the
        different interface.  
    
2004-03-30 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r28

        add something like it back in.

        state tag rather than having its own tag.
    * qareviewer.py: Catch exceptions from libxml2.treeError as well as
      libxml2.parserError
    * TODO: Logo item and needing something to "force" the user to edit output
      items when they could add useful information that the program can't
      guess.
    * data/checklist.dtd:
      - Remove input

    * TODO: Remove items that have been completed and notes to enhance others.
    * glade/qa-assistant.strings, glade/qa-assistant.glade: Remove the
      FileSelection dialog from the glade definition.  It's very easy to add
      fileSelectionDialogs programmatically so that's how I'm going to do it.
    
2004-03-29 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r25    
    * review.py: publish(filename) method implemented.  Call the publish method
      on a review object to print out the review.  Note:  further work could be
      done for word wrapping and WYSIWYG-ness.
    * qareviewer.py: connect publish menu item to review.publish()
    
2004-03-29 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r24    
    * review.py: Finish the display methods.  Implemented as a listStore that
      connects to the QAReviewer.checklist.tree row-changed signal and mirrors
      the data there.
    * checklist.py: Change resolution state from 'Needs Reviewing' to
      'Needs-Reviewing' because of limitations of DTD (Wish libxml2 did
      XML Schemas...)
    * qareviewer.py:
      - Allow editing the OUTPUT Field
      - Change resolution state names because of DTD
      - Change the reviewPane toggle to use hide/show rather than 
        remove/insert

      for adding validation to the checklist.py script.

    * qareviewer.py: Change fedora-* file names to qa-assistant* files
    * glade/fedora-qareviewer.glade, glade/fedora-qareviewer.gladep,

2004-03-28 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r21    
    * pixmaps, pixmaps/qa-icon.xcf, pixmaps/qa-icon.png: icon file for QA
      Assistant
    * properties.py: Initial work on a properties class to keep properties
      for the review
    * review.py: Initial, non-working start on the review widget.  May

      - Reorganized the method ordering to be more logical
      - Added docstrings for all completed methods

        working
    * TODO: Reorganized
    * SRPM.py: Initial work at an SRPM class to track the SRPM associated with
      the Review.  Works just barely.  Currently uses a system call to
      fedora-unrpm for part of its work and unrpms to a directory without
      being able to deal with that directory already existing.
    * glade/fedora-qareviewer.strings glade/fedora-qareviewer.glade: 
      - Added icons to the windows (Note: Probably should be done within the
        program instead.)
      - Added menu entries for all the features I can think of wanting to add.
    
2004-03-25 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r20

      individual checklist items

    * TODO: 
    * data/fedoraus.xml: Change from all lowercase to mixed case.
    * checklist.py, qareviewer.py, optionrenderer.py: Many changes to use my
      custom optionrenderer that simulates a combo box. 
    
2004-03-09 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r18    
    * Able to switch from review view to in-list view.
    
2004-03-04 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r17

      Reviews.
    
2004-03-02 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r10    
    * COPYING: checkin a copy of the GPL version 2

2004-02-29 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r9    
    * fedora-qatemplate: Merge sensible things from my version of fedora-md5.
      - Update version to 0.2
      - Add --checkhdr to check whether the rpm header agrees with the
        actual MD5Sums.
      - Redo the argument parsing because the old version only worked by
        accident.
      - Rework hash_file/hash_directory to output a hash rather than writing
        to an opened filehandle.
      - New functions get_hashes_from_rpm and perform_header_check to verify
        the RPM header MD5's against the actual md5s
    
2004-02-29 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r8

2004-02-07 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com> - r1    
    * Checkin my script and a directory layout.  The script performs hashing
      of source files fine but doesn't do any of the other stuff I have
      planned.
