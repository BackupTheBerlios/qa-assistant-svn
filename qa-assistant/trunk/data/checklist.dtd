                    believe it's possible to effectively use such a list in
                    a DTD.  XML Schemas might allow this, though.

             Contents: The name of one of the properties listed in the XML
                         file.  The program can test that the named argument
                         is a valid property but I don't believe it's possible
                         even with Schemas to validate within the XML.

             minlangver: Minimum version of the language which is required.
             maxlangver: Maximum version of the language allowed.

             Content: The test must follow the following conventions:
             * Takes the arguments listed above on the commandline in the order
               they are listed.
             * Return value keys to the status to set the checklist item to:
                 0 Pass
                 1 Fail
                 2 Non-Blocker
                 3 Not-Applicable
                 4 Needs-Reviewing
               4 Should be used when the test results do not imply anything
                 definite about the status of the code.
             * Anything printed to stdout will be used as the output string
               for the test.
             * As this is the first iteration of the testing code, there are
               sure to be future refinements to these requirements.
