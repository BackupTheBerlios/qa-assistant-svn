QA Assistant is a Gnome-Python application that assists a reviewer in
performing Quality Assurance.  It displays a checklist that the reviewer fills
in.  When the checklist is filled, the application outputs a review to a file
for the reviewer to submit.

Quick Install
-------------
::

  Download from sourceforge http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/qa-assistant
  $ tar -xzvf qa-assistant-VERSION.tar.gz
  $ cd qa-assistant-VERSION
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ su
  Password:
  # make install
  # exit
  $ qa-assistant

Features
--------
* Graphical GNOME Checklist Application
* Uses an XML definition of it's checklist for extensibility
* Current checklist targets Fedora.us/Fedora Extras Quality Assurance Process
  for verifying SRPM Packages
* A few automated tasks associated with SRPM QA
* Outputs a review suitable for publishing on fedora.us
* Adding of custom checklist items to a review
* Save and load functions
* Informational popup tips for filling in the checklist

Requirements
------------
* python 2.2 (2.3 is now the development platform.  Conditional code to use
  python 2.2 is present but needs testing.)
* python bindings for libxml2
* pygtk version 2.2.0 or higher.
* pygnome version 2.0.0 or higher.
* python-rpm
* Unix system to run on

The current code includes a checklist that works with the Quality Assurance
process of Fedora.us, the contributed packages section of the Fedora Linux
Distribution.  As the code matures, more attention will be given to
creating modules for other QA situations.

qa-assistant is hosted at sourceforge:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/qa-assistant

Until sourceforge hosts subversion repositories the development source code
is available from my home system:

The currently implemented checklist is to aid Quality Assurance of SRPMS for
the Fedora Extras Project:
