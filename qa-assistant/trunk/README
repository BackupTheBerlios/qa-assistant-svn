Getting the Code
----------------

The current code includes a checklist that works with the Quality Assurance
process of Fedora.us, the contributed packages section of the Fedora Linux
Distribution.  As the code matures, more attention will be given to
creating modules for other QA situations.

qa-assistant is hosted at sourceforge:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/qa-assistant

Until sourceforge hosts subversion repositories the development source code
is available from my home system:

  http://springer.homelinux.com:8080/svn/fedora/qa-assistant/trunk

The currently implemented checklist is to aid Quality Assurance of SRPMS for
the Fedora Extras Project:
