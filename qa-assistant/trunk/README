QA Assistant -- Gnome Quality Assurance checklist

QA Assistant is a Gnome-Python application that assists a reviewer in
performing Quality Assurance.  It creates a checklist that the reviewer fills
in.  When the checklist is filled, the application prints out a review for the
reviewer to submit.  The current code includes a checklist that works with
the Quality Assurance process of Fedora.us, the contributed packages section
of the Fedora Linux Distribution.  As the code matures, more attention will
be focused on creating modules for other QA situations.

Quality Assurance consists of inspecting a variety of similar products to be
certain that they conform to certain standards for proper working.  Currently,
although there is a large body of automated quality assurance methods
(automated testing), there is a lack of open source tools to help with human
driven QA.  QA Assistant fills this gap by displaying a checklist in a
friendly, GUIfied manner for the human reviewer to fill out.

QA Assistant is currently usable.  It has a GUI, working checklist for the
Fedora Project, and can output a review.  Still to be worked on are an
interface to bugzilla (reading information from a ticket and submitting
output to a ticket), associating the checklist with a set of actions the
program can perform automatically, using GConf2 for preferences, a new
display widget that can display and allow editing of the XML format of the
Review, and general speedups.

Requirements:
* python 2.2 (2.3 not tested.  Code to use python-2.3's features is in
  the works.)
* python bindings for libxml2
* pygnome2 and pygtk2
* python-rpm
* Unix system to run on

Features:
* Graphical GNOME Checklist Application
* Uses an XML definition of it's checklist for extensibility
* Current checklist targets Fedora.us/Fedora Extras Quality Assurance Process
  for verifying SRPM Packages
* A few automated tasks associated with SRPM QA

From version 0.3 on, qa-assistant is being hosted at sourceforge:

The only currently implemented checklist is one to aid in QA of SRPMS.
It is compatible with the documentation and goals for the contributed packages
section of the Fedora Linux Project.  In particular, the contributed packages
