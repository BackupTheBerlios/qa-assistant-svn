Gnome Quality Assurance checklist
=================================

QA Assistant is a Gnome-Python application that assists a reviewer in
performing Quality Assurance.  It displays a checklist that the reviewer fills
in.  When the checklist is filled, the application outputs a review to a file
for the reviewer to submit.

Quick Install
-------------
* Download from sourceforge http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/qa-assistant
  $ tar -xzvf qa-assistant-VERSION.tar.gz
  $ cd qa-assistant-VERSION
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ python qa-assistant	[OPTIONAL: to test qa-assistant]
  $ su
  Password:
  # make install
  # exit
  $ qa-assistant

Features
========
* Graphical GNOME Checklist Application
* Uses an XML definition of it's checklist for extensibility
* Current checklist targets Fedora.us/Fedora Extras Quality Assurance Process
  for verifying SRPM Packages
* A few automated tasks associated with SRPM QA

Requirements
============
* python 2.2 (2.3 is now the development platform.  Conditional code to use
  python 2.2 is present and needs testing.)
* python bindings for libxml2
* pygnome and pygtk version 2.2.0 or higher.
* python-rpm
* Unix system to run on

The current code includes a checklist that works with the Quality Assurance
process of Fedora.us, the contributed packages section of the Fedora Linux
Distribution.  As the code matures, more attention will be focused on
creating modules for other QA situations.

QA Assistant is currently usable.  It has a GUI, working checklist for the
Fedora Extras Project, save and load functionality, adding arbitrary items,
and can output a review.  Still to be worked on are an
interface to bugzilla (reading information from a ticket and submitting
output to a ticket), associating the checklist with a set of actions the
program can perform automatically, using GConf2 for preferences, a new
display widget that allows editing of the review, and checklists for other
Quality Assurance situations.

From version 0.3 on, qa-assistant is being hosted at sourceforge:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/qa-assistant

subversion repository is currently offline until Verizon upgrades the DSL
line at my new house.  When that happens it will be available at:
  http://springer.homelinux.com:8080/svn/fedora/qa-assistant/trunk
Command line:
  svn co http://springer.homelinux.com:8080/svn/fedora/qa-assistant/trunk qa-assistant

The only currently implemented checklist is one to aid in QA of SRPMS for
the Fedora Linux Project:
  http://www.fedora.us
