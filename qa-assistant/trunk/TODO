glade/GUI:
==========
- Publish Button should be added to toolbar

- Submit Button should be added to toolbar
  + Pressing Submit will build the review and submit upstream and down.

- Add a New dialog to take input about bugzilla
  + If new then make sure we have both a bugzilla # and an SRPM

- Pressing save should dump the present state to an xml file
  + class SaveFile

- Pressing open should load a dumped xml file

- Create a logo to go along with the icon.  Think up some other small pixmaps
  for the menu/toolbar: toggle Preview, new from bugzilla, new from SRPM,
  Publish Report, Submit Report

- When the reviewer really should add additional information, how should we
  make it happen?  A field in the XML file under state?  And that causes
  qa-assistant to pop up a textEntry dialog when the item enters that state?

Extra GNOME Functionality:
==========================
- Create preferences infrastructure : check PREFERENCES for ideas.

Programming:
============
- Command line argument parsing
  + If a savefile is given, open that

- Enhance tracking entries into the editor.  We want
  people to be able to shift text around from Needswork and Non-blocker, and
  to add to them but we want to keep track of what entry is associated with
  what entry id.

- Ability to add non-checklist item review items: ie "Fails to call my dog
  into dinner which is what I expect gdogcaller to do."

- Automate some review tasks
  + checkheader
  + checksig
  + verify source against spec file/canonical URL
  + look at the new fedora-startqa for more ideas.  Perhaps we can coordinate
    and use fedora-startqa in the backend.  (Look through their SRPM stuff --
    it might be better code than I have... If we can put it into a SRPM class
    like I have, then it could be callable from either my script or theirs.)

- review.publish needs to do wordwrapping of lines.  Look into whether a
  textBuffer object has the necessary wordwrapping even without a textView.
  (python 2.3's textwrap would do this for publish, not sure about viewing.)

- Update to the fedora QAFormat output style

Build Infrastructure:
=====================
- Write a spec file
