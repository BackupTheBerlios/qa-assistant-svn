Preferences to Add Via GConf
============================

Preferences
-----------
Preferences are set on the app.  They could be implemented as GConf
variables.

Person
* Whether to sign [s]
* Signing identity [s]

Display
* Automatically display failed reviews [s] [c]
* Text colours [s] [c]
* Tooltip DESCRIPTION enable/disable [s]
* Tooltip timeout [s]

Files
* Directory to unrpm into [s]

Status Key:
  [s] In schema
  [c] Used in Code
  [d] Settable via preferences dialog

Coding wise we need three things:

1) We need to write the gconf schema file describing the keys.

  * Need to take a look at other schemas and decide how to structure the
    keys.  Right now it's a flat structure.  We need to think about a hierarchy
    that makes sense.
  
2) Write code to make use of the values.
  * Where should the GConfClient reside?  If each place that uses it has a
    copy, it's wasteful but modular.  OTOH, gconf.client_get_default() doesn't
    seem to create a new client, just get a reference to a main gconf client.
    The app keeps a copy of it, then it needs to pass the client to the other
    modules somehow. [Going with each module that uses it]
  * Colors: When initially creating the checklist, we need to create
     properties for the output color states.
     - When the color changes, GConfClient is notified.  When that happens,
       call a function to change the values of the checklist OUTPUT to the new
       values.
       [Ugh.  ths would mean changing each of the OUTPUT strings, not just the
       ones that are displayed.  Maybe we want to move back to pangoizing on
       DISPLAY, rather than PANGOIZE on entry into the checklist.]  So values
       in OUTPUTLIST are unpangoized.  values in OUTPUT are pangoized.  Values
       in OUTPUT that are changed are entered into OUTPUTLIST and then
       pangoized.] [check]

3) We need to have a dialog box that has entries for all the properties.
   This can be a glade dialog as the box should be the same for all checklists.
   The dialog needs to take input about all the preferences listed here.
   When the submit button is pressed, put the information into the gconf
   database and change the effect of the values on the program.

(This one is a program property.  It should start out as the current working
directory everytime the program starts and change as the program progresses.)
* File directories

(Hmmm is this a gpg option instead?)
* Keyserver to download new keys from

Properties?
* Submit to bugzilla or publish to file

Druid?
* Default QA checklist to load

Properties
----------
Properties are set on the checklist.  The checklist type should provide a
set of properties that are legal.  Perhaps implement as GObject values on
the checklist object.

* MD5Sums
* Bugzilla URL
* SRPM to check
* QA checklist loaded
