Preferences to Add Via GConf
============================

Preferences
-----------
Preferences are set on the app.  They could be implemented as GConf
variables.

Person
(Probably happen in the review widget, publish function.)
* Whether to sign [s] [d] [c]
* Signing identity [s] [d] [c]
* Path to gpg binary [s] [d] [c]

Files
(Probably happen in the main program)
* Directory to unrpm into [s] [d]

Display
(Happen in the checklist.)
* Automatically display failed reviews [s] [c] [d]
* Text colours [s] [c] [d]

  (These can probably be implemented in the checkview and cause settings
  to change on the checkview's treetip.)
* Tooltip DESCRIPTION enable/disable [s] [c] [d]
* Tooltip timeout [s] [c] [d]

Status Key:
  [s] In schema
  [c] Used in Code
  [d] Settable via preferences dialog

Coding wise we need three things:

1) We need to write the gconf schema file describing the keys.
   [Done]

2) Write code to make use of the values.
  * Where should the GConfClient reside?  If each place that uses it has a
    copy, it's wasteful but modular.  OTOH, gconf.client_get_default() doesn't
    seem to create a new client, just get a reference to a main gconf client.
    The app keeps a copy of it, then it needs to pass the client to the other
    modules somehow. [Going with each module that uses it]
    [Test then Done]

3) We need to have a dialog box that has entries for all the properties.
   This can be a glade dialog as the box should be the same for all checklists.
   The dialog needs to take input about all the preferences listed here.
   When the submit button is pressed, put the information into the gconf
   database and change the effect of the values on the program.
   [Test then Done]

(These are program properties.  It should start out as the current working
directory everytime the program starts and change as the program progresses.
The passphrase will be asked for every time.)
* File directories [done]
* user/gpg-pasphrase  [done]

(Hmmm is this a gpg option instead?)
* Keyserver to download new keys from

Druid
-----
In the new scheme of things we need to know what checklist to load before we
can do useful things.  Once we know what checklist to load, we should be able
to invoke functions to take onLoad information from users.

The Druid will have the following pathways:
1) Info screen.
2) (A) Load savefile (B) New checklist
3A) Open a file chooser with the CWD for the user to pick from
3B) Open a selector of the system installed checklists
4pre) Load checklist
4) Display a properties dialog to get the properties that the checklist
   requires (onLoad) if any.
5) Start the program.

When loading a new checklist after the program is started, we should skip
1 & 2 and go directly to 3A.

When loading a saved checklist we want to popup a file selector (could be
the Druid page or the Druid file selector could be the load checklist file
selector.)  Then proceed to 4pre.

Properties
----------
Properties are set on the checklist.  The checklist type should provide a
set of properties that are legal.  Perhaps implement as GObject values on
the checklist object (Can't do this as it isn't extensible.  The checklist
may have arbitrary properties.  Specifying in GObject makes them a
"compiletime" rather than run-time setting.)

* MD5Sums
* Bugzilla URL
* SRPM to check
* QA checklist loaded

We have a properties dict in the CheckList right now.
What are we going to do with that?

We need the following attributes on functions:

* automatic/userinput/useroverride
* onLoad(Mandatory before we start)/onPublish(mandatory before we end)/optional

The current checklist.dtd encapsulates these in the following ways.  As
RequireTypes:

* onLoad (start, user)
* onPublish (end, user)
* automatic (when its dependencies resolve, automatic)
* optional (optional, user)

overrides are implemented as user invocable functions.

Functions
---------

Functions are tied into properties.  Both are declared by the checklist.
Properties are defined in the checklist while functions are defined in code
modules.  Functions can operate on Properties.  And they can take properties
as arguments.

So each Function module has to have access to the checklist's properties.
How?

Most functions are selectable from a menu entry.  How does this affect
things?  We need to create a menu from the functions and assign the
functions as callbacks.  The functions in the menu need to have access to
the properties.  They also need to use functions on the review (publish) and
gconf things (Enable/disable treetips)

Create a QAMenu class that takes the checklist as its model.  When the 

Functions that are not in the menu are functions used by the properties
themselves.  These functions often need to specify dependency information on
other properties.

Other things that get set depending on the checklist:

* Application's title bar: app.set_title()
* Appplication's status bar: app.mainWinAppBar.push()
  - Ideas for statusbar info:
    + The main identifier of the review (SRPM name)
    + Number of pass/fail/needs-reviewing/etc

* So we don't have to inline all our code, we probably want to have a method
  to callout to other code.  Maybe there should be a certain set of standard
  functions.  Then we can add per checklist functions in a separate file.  The
  checklist can let us know which functions its using via a name/sha1sum pair.
  They can then reference the functions in that external file.
