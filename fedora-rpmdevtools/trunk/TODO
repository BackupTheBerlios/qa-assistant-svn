Colorize output depending on the resolution state (green for pass,
red for blocker, pink for let it slide.)

tooltip like popup for DESCRIPTIONS of each checklist item

Identify what SRPM/ bugzilla/ package we're working on in the status bar

Extra GNOME Functionality:
==========================
Create preferences infrastructure : check PREFERENCES for ideas.

Figure out the best way to add default paths to our data files.
(Look at gnome-blog)

Programming:
============
Process command line argument parsing

Figure out how we are going to track entries into the editor.  We want
people to be able to shift text around from Needswork and Non-blocker, and
to add to them but we want to keep track of what entry is associated with what
entry id.

Possibility of creating a list view of the output sorted on the RESOLUTION
rather than reviewPane textareas.

Save file functionality

Automate some review tasks
MD5Sum
checkheader
checksig
verify source against spec file/canonical URL

SRPM.py needs a lot of work.  It currently barely works.

XML:
====
In our xml file, we must give each entry a unique id.

DTD for our xml files

Create at least one complete checklist.

Resolution states: Pass, Needswork, Non-Blocker, N/A, Needs Reviewing
Needs Reviewing is provided by the program right now as a default state....
